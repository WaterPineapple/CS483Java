#+TITLE: Project structure 
-------

#+BEGIN_SRC
This project doesn't use a build tool like Maven/Gradle for dependencies and libraries
which would actually be beneficial because most these utility methods and stuff already
exists, but that would defeat the purpose of this self-project.

This means that to run code also, you would need to compile them yourself and then run 
them because there is no ./gradlew run etc...

Project structure might not be the regular src/test and src/main and just be jumbled 
together for faster code writing

I did the comparison sorts using Reference types that extend Comparable, since we 
are doing a comparison sort. Please do keep in mind that creating a bunch of 
Objects is not a good practice when you can just create primitives due to Memory.

However I left as it is, because it is to distinguish b/w comparison sort/vs not.

Even though I hate comments, there are some pre/post conditions I put for general
API I will write like Priority Queues and etc... but not for algorithm testing code
like QuickSort1 and etc...

All of this is for good fun and self practice and revisiting stuff.
